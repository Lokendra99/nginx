# Deployment using Nginx

## Problem statement -
```
a) Install Nginx on your computer and run it.
b) Host the assignment completed in previous level on your localhost using Nginx.
c) Create Error pages - 404 (Not Found) and 500(internal server error) and point to
   these error pages in your Nginx configuration file. The configuration file should
   make sure that when the route 404 or 500 is called, the nginx web server is
   serving the page you created rather than its default page.
   ```
